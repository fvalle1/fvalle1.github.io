## ALICE experiment at CERN
I [contribute](https://github.com/gabrielefronze/alice-MTR-utils/graphs/contributors) to [https://github.com/gabrielefronze/alice-MTR-utils](https://github.com/gabrielefronze/alice-MTR-utils), a series of utilities to generate plots in an automatic way.

## Cosmic Rays
I made a project called *Analisi di raggi cosmici con Supercomputer* during High school.

I developed code to make a montecarlo simulation about interaction of cosmic rays with atmoshpere, code was developed using *openMP*. I ran it on a multiprocessor machine.

You may find [more information](http://www.slideshare.net/FilippoValle2/tesina-analisi-di-raggi-cosmici-e-supercomputer) about this research.

This work is referenced [here](http://www.istitutomoro.it/area-studenti-e-famiglie/esame-di-stato/esempi-di-tesine/analisi-di-raggi-cosmici-mediante-supercomputer/).

## Photos
I really love **taking photos**, on [Flickr](https://flic.kr/ps/35x3u4) you may find picutures I took to subjects like our **moon**, stars and so on (Yep, I love **astronomy!**)

## Diceware
I [contributed](http://www.taringamberini.com/it/diceware_it_IT/lista-di-parole-diceware-in-italiano/contributi/) to the italian version of **Diceware**.

## Physics
I was [interviewed](http://www.carnevaledellafisica.it/2014/11/dal-liceo-alla-facolta-di-fisica.html) about my passion of physics.

## One more thing...
I'm trying to do some other great things, so stay tuned!
